## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we love contributions, whether in the form of docs, code, graphics, or anything else.

However, we do have some basic rules:

- Do not create GitHub issues without first talking to us on Discord. Many problems that initially seem like bugs are often user issues that can be fixed with a little help. Ask first!
- Please be aware of our AI policy, shown below.

## AI Policy

- It is okay to use AI to help you write code, however **all submitted code must be vetted, understood, and maintained by the person submitting it.**
- Purely AI-generated vibe-coded PRs are **not welcome**.
- AI-generated documentation updates are okay, **as long as a human has checked the output and it makes sense.**
