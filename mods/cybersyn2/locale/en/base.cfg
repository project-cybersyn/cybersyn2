[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn2-setting-enable-logistics=Globally enable or disable logistics. If disabled, no deliveries will be scheduled.
cybersyn2-setting-debug=Enable debug mode. This will render additional information on the map regarding Cybersyn's internal state, as well as additional logging and tracing facilities. This can help diagnose issues, but will decrease performance.
cybersyn2-setting-work-period=The period in ticks between each unit of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks. Smaller is faster, and will improve responsiveness at the expense of performance. The minimum setting of 1 results in work being done every tick.
cybersyn2-setting-work-factor=The amount of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks each period. This number acts as a generic multiplier on work per period, with 1 being default, 2 being double the work, 0.5 being half the work, and so on. Smaller numbers can improve performance if there is stuttering. Larger numbers can improve responsiveness for large saves.
cybersyn2-setting-combinator-latency=Cybersyn will guarantee that at least this many ticks elapse between a delivery being dispatched to a particular station and its inventory being polled again, at the expense of delaying the dispatch loop if necessary. Leave this value at its default unless you have very deep combinator networks causing issues.
