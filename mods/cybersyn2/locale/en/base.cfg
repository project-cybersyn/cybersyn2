[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn2-setting-enable-logistics=Globally enable or disable logistics. If disabled, no deliveries will be scheduled.
cybersyn2-setting-debug=Enable debug mode. This will render additional information on the map regarding Cybersyn's internal state, as well as additional logging and tracing facilities. This can help diagnose issues, but will decrease performance.
cybersyn2-setting-work-period=The period in ticks between each unit of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks. Smaller is faster, and will improve responsiveness at the expense of performance. The minimum setting of 1 results in work being done every tick.
cybersyn2-setting-work-factor=The amount of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks each period. This number acts as a generic multiplier on work per period, with 1 being default, 2 being double the work, 0.5 being half the work, and so on. Smaller numbers can improve performance if there is stuttering. Larger numbers can improve responsiveness for large saves.
cybersyn2-setting-network-mask=Default network mask. This value will be used for stations that have a network virtual signal but no network mask set.
cybersyn2-setting-channel-mask=Default item channel mask. This value will be used for the item channel mask on all stations that do not explicitly set a mask with a Channels combinator.
cybersyn2-setting-warmup-time=The time in seconds that a station will wait after being built before being eligible for deliveries. This is to give bots time to fully build the station before deliveries are attempted.
cybersyn2-setting-queue-limit=The maximum number of deliveries that can be queued for a station beyond its train limit. A setting of 0 means no limit.
