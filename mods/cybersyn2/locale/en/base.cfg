[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn2-setting-enable-logistics=Globally enable or disable logistics. If disabled, no deliveries will be scheduled.
cybersyn2-setting-debug-level=Set the level of debug information that is displayed and logged.\n\n"NONE" disables logging.\n"INFO" displays debug overlays and logs high level information.\n"TRACE" logs detailed step-by-step information useful for diagnosing issues.\n\nNOTE: This setting (especially on TRACE) has a negative impact on performance. Use with caution.
cybersyn2-setting-work-period=The period in ticks between each unit of work done by Cybersyn's threads. Smaller is faster, and will improve responsiveness at the expense of higher CPU usage. The minimum setting of 1 results in work being done every tick.
cybersyn2-setting-work-factor=The amount of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks each period. This number acts as a generic multiplier on work per period, with 1 being default, 2 being double the work, 0.5 being half the work, and so on. Smaller numbers can improve performance if there is stuttering. Larger numbers can improve responsiveness for large saves.
cybersyn2-setting-warmup-time=The time in seconds that a station will wait after being built before being eligible for deliveries. This is to give bots time to fully build the station before deliveries are attempted.
cybersyn2-setting-vehicle-warmup-time=The time in seconds that a vehicle will wait after being built before being eligible for deliveries. This is to give bots time to finish building and delivering fuel for the train before it begins delivering.
cybersyn2-setting-queue-limit=The number of trains that can be queued to a station beyond its stated train limit. Trains in a queue will be routed to depot until they can proceed. In large networks, raising this number can improve responsiveness by allowing trains to be routed outside of the dispatch loop.
cybersyn2-setting-excess-delivery-limit=The number of total deliveries beyond its train limit that can be sent to a station globally. This value differs from the queue limit in that it applies globally to all deliveries addressing a given station. In large networks, raising this number can allow more trains to circulate per loop. However, setting this too high may lead to excessive train queueing in situations of overproduction.
cybersyn2-setting-default-auto-threshold-percent=The default percentage of the total request amount that will be used as the threshold for routing requests.
cybersyn2-setting-default-train-fullness-percent=The default percentage of the total train cargo capacity that should be filled before a train will deliver an outstanding request.
cybersyn2-setting-default-netmask=The default network mask to use when one is not provided as a signal.

[cybersyn2-alerts]
no-station=Train stop has no station combinator.
too-many-station=Train stop has too many station combinators.
too-many-allowlist=Train stop has too many allow list combinators.
train-stop-limit-zero=Train stop has its limit set to zero, which will break Cybersyn's routing.

debugger-command-help=Open the Cybersyn debugger window.
log-all-command-help=Log all Cybersyn strace messages to the console. This will create a lot of output, and is not recommended for normal use.
