[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn2-setting-enable-logistics=Globally enable or disable logistics. If disabled, no deliveries will be scheduled.
cybersyn2-setting-debug=Enable debug mode. This will render additional information on the map regarding Cybersyn's internal state, as well as additional logging and tracing facilities. This can help diagnose issues, but will decrease performance.
cybersyn2-setting-work-period=The period in ticks between each unit of work done by Cybersyn's threads. Smaller is faster, and will improve responsiveness at the expense of higher CPU usage. The minimum setting of 1 results in work being done every tick.
cybersyn2-setting-work-factor=The amount of work done by Cybersyn's background tasks each period. This number acts as a generic multiplier on work per period, with 1 being default, 2 being double the work, 0.5 being half the work, and so on. Smaller numbers can improve performance if there is stuttering. Larger numbers can improve responsiveness for large saves.
cybersyn2-setting-warmup-time=The time in seconds that a station will wait after being built before being eligible for deliveries. This is to give bots time to fully build the station before deliveries are attempted.
cybersyn2-setting-vehicle-warmup-time=The time in seconds that a vehicle will wait after being built before being eligible for deliveries. This is to give bots time to finish building and delivering fuel for the train before it begins delivering.
cybersyn2-setting-queue-limit=The number of deliveries that can be queued at a source beyond its train limit. In large networks, raising this number can improve responsiveness by allowing trains to be routed outside of the dispatch loop.
cybersyn2-setting-default-auto-threshold-percent=The default percentage of the total request amount that will be used as the auto threshold for requests when auto thresholds are enabled.

[cybersyn2-alerts]
no-station=Train stop has no station combinator.
too-many-station=Train stop has too many station combinators.
too-many-allowlist=Train stop has too many allow list combinators.
train-stop-limit-zero=Train stop has its limit set to zero, which will break Cybersyn's routing.

[cybersyn2-commands]

force-reset-command-help=Force an internal state reset even when not recommended. [color=red]WARNING: use /cs2-reset instead![/color]
debugger-command-help=Open the Cybersyn debugger window.
log-all-command-help=Log all Cybersyn strace messages to the console. This will create a lot of output, and is not recommended for normal use.
