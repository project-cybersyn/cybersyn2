cargo=Cargo
cargo-tooltip=Determines whether deliveries can pick up, drop off, or both. Setting the switch to the center position allows both inbound and outbound deliveries.

network-tooltip=The default item network for this station. All requests and provides will be made on this network unless overridden by the specific requesting or providing order.
provide-all=Auto provide all
provide-all-tooltip=If checked, this station will provide its entire inventory when in provide mode. If unchecked, provided inventory must be given explicitly.
true-inventory-signals=Set the station's true inventory. The true inventory is the positive net value of all cargo present at this station. [font=default-bold]Required for basic operation.[/font]
priority-signal=Set the default priority for all orders at this station.
order-signals=Sets cargo orders. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate requested cargo. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate provided cargo.
auto-mds=Auto minimum delivery size (percent)
auto-mds-tooltip=If checked, this station will automatically calculate inbound delivery sizes as a percent of requested amounts.
auto-mds-percent-tooltip=Percentage (1-100) of requested amount to use as minimum delivery size.
topology=Topology
topology-tooltip=Manually assign this station to a specific topology by placing a virtual signal here. Leaving blank will assign the station to the default topology associated to the station's surface.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-manifest]
desc=Outputs the [font=default-bold]manifest[/font] of the parked train in the form of item and fluid signals. The manifest reflects the desired cargo of the train, and may be different than the actual cargo.
output-signals=Cargo and quantities of this train's manifest. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate items the train is dropping off. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate items the train is picking up.
signal-dropoff=Signal: Dropping off
tooltip-dropoff=If the parked train is dropping off cargo, this signal will be set to a value of 1 in the output.
signal-pickup=Signal: Picking up
tooltip-pickup=If the parked train is picking up cargo, this signal will be set to a value of 1 in the output.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-delivery-size]
set-inbound-delivery-size=Set inbound delivery size
set-inbound-delivery-size-tooltip=If enabled, inbound delivery sizes for cargo will be set by the input signals.
set-outbound-delivery-size=Set outbound delivery size
set-outbound-delivery-size-tooltip=If enabled, outbound delivery sizes for cargo will be set by the input signals.
desc=Stations will not receive deliveries below their [font=default-bold]inbound delivery size[/font]. Delivery sizes apply to each item separately.
cargo-inputs=Set checked sizes for individual cargo at this station. Each cargo's delivery size will be set to its signal value.
all-items=Set checked sizes for all items at this station.
all-fluids=Set checked sizes for all fluids at this station.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-channels]
desc=Items can be assigned to any of 32 [font=default-bold]channels[/font] using bitmasks. Items will only be delivered between stations that have that item on the [font=default-bold]same channel[/font] as determined by the bitwise AND of the bitmasks.
item-channels=Set item channels for individual cargo at this station. Each cargo's channel mask will be set to its signal value.
all-item-channels=Set the default channel mask for this station. (Applies to fluids as well.)

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-prio]
desc=Sets the [font=default-bold]priority[/font] of items for this station. Higher-priority consumers of an item are served first for that item. Amongst producers otherwise matched with a consumer, the highest priority producer will make the delivery.
set-per-item=Set priorities for individual items at this station. Each item's priority will be set to its signal value.
set-all=Set the default priority for all items and fluids at this station.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-wagon]
desc=Outputs the [font=default-bold]manifest[/font] of the nearest wagon in the form of item and fluid signals. The manifest reflects the desired cargo of the wagon, and may be different than the actual cargo.
output-signals=Cargo and quantities of this wagon's manifest. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate items the train is dropping off. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate items the train is picking up.
per-wagon-manifest=Per-wagon manifest
per-wagon-manifest-tooltip=When checked, at producers, the train's cargo manifest will be split between wagons and the manifest for the nearest wagon will be output by this combinator. At consumers, a snapshot of the wagon's inventory will be output. When unchecked, no cargo splitting will be done and no manifest will be output.
live-wagon-inventory=Live wagon inventory
live-wagon-inventory-tooltip=When checked, the inventory of the nearest wagon will be read in real-time and summed into the output of this combinator.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-shared-inventory]
desc=When associated with a stop, allows the stop to participate in shared inventory with other stops. Stops can be connected and disconnected to the common shared inventory using this combinator.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-inventory]
desc=Provides additional inputs for the station's inventory. The [font=default-bold][color=red]red[/color][/font] and [font=default-bold][color=green]green[/color][/font] input wires are treated as two independent inventory orders.
network-signals=Sets item networks for this order. The items will be put on the item networks corresponding to any non-zero virtual signal values.
priority-signal=Sets the priority for this order. Greater values indicate higher priority.
all-items-signal=A negative value on this signal causes all available items to be requested. The value is interpreted as the number of free item slots in this station's storage.
all-fluids-signal=A negative value on this signal causes all available fluids to be requested. The value is interpreted as the amount of free fluid storage capacity at this station.
and=AND
or=OR

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-wagon-contents]
desc=Outputs the [font=default-bold]current contents[/font] of the nearest wagon in the form of item and fluid signals.
output-signals=Cargo and quantities representing this wagon's current contents.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-deliveries]
desc=Outputs the sum of the manifests of [font=default-bold]all deliveries[/font] to and/or from this station in the form of item and fluid signals.
output-signals=Net cargo and quantities of all delivery manifests. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate items to be dropped off. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate items to be picked up.
