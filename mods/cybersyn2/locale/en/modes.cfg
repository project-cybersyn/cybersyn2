[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-prio]
desc=Sets the [font=default-bold]priority[/font] of items for this station. Higher-priority consumers of an item are served first for that item. Amongst producers otherwise matched with a consumer, the highest priority producer will make the delivery.
set-per-item=Set priorities for individual items at this station. Each item's priority will be set to its signal value.
set-all=Set the default priority for all items and fluids at this station.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-wagon]

input-signals=Cargo and quantities of this wagon's manifest. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate items the train is dropping off. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate items the train is picking up.
