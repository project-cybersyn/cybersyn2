use-external-inventory=Use external inventory
use-external-inventory-tooltip=If checked, use an externally provided inventory for this station, rather than the station's default internal inventory. The [virtual-signal=cybersyn2-inventory] signal must be used to provide the external inventory ID.
dump=Dump
dump-tooltip=If checked, this station will behave as a push logistics dump.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-prio]
desc=Sets the [font=default-bold]priority[/font] of items for this station. Higher-priority consumers of an item are served first for that item. Amongst producers otherwise matched with a consumer, the highest priority producer will make the delivery.
set-per-item=Set priorities for individual items at this station. Each item's priority will be set to its signal value.
set-all=Set the default priority for all items and fluids at this station.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-wagon]
desc=Outputs the [font=default-bold]manifest[/font] of the nearest wagon in the form of item and fluid signals. The manifest reflects the desired cargo of the wagon, and may be different than the actual cargo.
input-signals=Cargo and quantities of this wagon's manifest. [font=default-bold]Positive[/font] signals indicate items the train is dropping off. [font=default-bold]Negative[/font] signals indicate items the train is picking up.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-shared-inventory]
desc=When associated with a stop, allows the stop to participate in shared inventory with other stops. Stops can be connected and disconnected to the common shared inventory using this combinator.

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-inventory]
desc=Provides control inputs for an [font=default-bold]inventory[/font].

[cybersyn2-combinator-mode-wagon-contents]
desc=Outputs the [font=default-bold]current contents[/font] of the nearest wagon in the form of item and fluid signals.
output-signals=Cargo and quantities representing this wagon's current contents.
