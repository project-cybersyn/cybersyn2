# Cybersyn 2

Cybersyn 2 is the next generation of the [Project Cybersyn](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cybersyn) train logistics mod. Rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of new Factorio 2.0 features, solve more logistics problems, and fix fundamental issues with CS1 while keeping the same low UPS footprint, Cybersyn 2 aims to be the final word in Factorio train logistics.

## About Cybersyn 2

Cybersyn 2 is a train logistics mod, meaning it routes trains around your train network to carry desired items from providers to requesters. CS2 is *vastly* more capable than similar train logistics systems, including Factorio's built-in interrupt driven system as well as various prior mods in this category.

It can solve logistics problems like byproduct management and voiding, temporary item storage and retrieval, multi-item deliveries, quality management and upcycling, connecting bot malls to train networks, and basically anything else you can think of.

If this sounds like what you need, Cybersyn 2 is for you. To get started, you'll want to begin with CS2's [official online documentation](https://project-cybersyn.github.io/cybersyn2/).

We also have a very helpful community on our [official Discord](https://discord.gg/zmgUBu95HX). After reading the documentation, feel free to ask in Discord if you have any further questions or issues.

*NOTE: While the mod is in Alpha, please use the CS2 Alpha discord channel for discussion. You can request access upon joining Discord.*

## Getting Started with Cybersyn 2

Cybersyn 2 has [official online documentation](https://project-cybersyn.github.io/cybersyn2/) which is maintained alongside the mod's code.

## Coming from the original Project Cybersyn

**WARNING: Due to fundamental changes in how inventory inputs are provided, there is no direct migration from CS1 to CS2.** CS2 is primarily recommended for new saves. It is also possible to run CS2 in parallel with CS1 and incrementally adopt it.

Although those coming from the original Project Cybersyn should find themselves on very familiar ground, there are quite a few changes and improvements to be aware of. Even veterans of CS1 will want to read the [official online documentation](https://project-cybersyn.github.io/cybersyn2/) before getting started.
