# Networks

Deliveries can only be made between Cybersyn stations that share appropriate networks.

## Networks

Networks are defined by Factorio virtual signals.

## Subnetworks

Subnetworks are defined by bitmasks associated to each network key. Two subnetworks overlap if the bitwise `AND` operation on their bits is not zero.
